WEALTH2                     Wealth Rating
                            Wealth rating uses median family income and
                            population statistics from each area to
                            index relative wealth within each state
                            The segments are denoted 0-9, with 9 being
                            the highest income group and zero being the
                            lowest. Each rating has a different meaning
                            within each state.

MDMAUD                      The Major Donor Matrix code
                            The codes describe frequency and amount of
                            giving for donors who have given a $100+
                            gift at any time in their giving history.
                            An RFA (recency/frequency/monetary) field.

                            The (current) concatenated version is a nominal
                            or symbolic field. The individual bytes could separately be
                            used as fields and refer to the following:

                            First byte: Recency of Giving

                              2=Two-Four gifts in the period of recency
                              5=Five+ gifts in the period of recency

                            3rd byte: Amount of Giving
                              L=Less than $100(Low Dollar)
                              C=$100-499(Core)

                            4th byte: Blank/meaningless/filler

                            'X' indicates that the donor is not a major donor.

                            For more information regarding the RFA codes, see
